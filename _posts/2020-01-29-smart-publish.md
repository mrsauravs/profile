<center><b>Smart Publishing</b> is based on smart contract. A smart contract is basically a blockchain.</center><br>
     
Internet of things (IoT) can be referred to a number of interconnected things. We are now part of a vicious web that spins all across the globe. Today, IoT is as dumb as Internet. It needs people and their data for its sustainability. Corporations are fueled with engineers to weave an interwoven web of data that connects everyone to everything. Some of us have accepted it wholeheartedly but some are still concerned. Without being concerned about the privacy and security, we are still seeing an avalanche of newer and better technologies joining hands with IoT. In this digital era, almost everything speaks to each other, no matter how you set your privacy levels. The most recent technology that hit IoT is blockchain and I refer precisely to a Smart Contract.

## Blockchain: Basics
Blockchain is a cryptographically secure data block bound together in a chain with no central supervision. And yes, we are referring to a decentralized economy and business model. In this type of chain, the input of one block depends on the output of its preceding block and are connected through hash pointers. If any malicious attempt been made to tamper, it will quickly affect the entire chain and thereby will freeze the entire chain.

## Smart Contract: What it does?
A legal contract must suffice some criteria such as of being offered, mutually consented, legal, signed, and must be accepted by the other party. A smart contract is a digital version of it and is smart not only because it is digital but for its underlying technology, blockchain.

There are two sides to look into. One being the program and the other being economics.

Programmatically speaking, a miner will create a block with the message, will append a nonce (any random hexadecimal value), and then hash it. Blockchain uses a SHA256 hashing technique which means that any length of string can be put as input and after hashing it will produce a fixed length string of 256 bits. This will make the block approved and will show the proof-of-work. Proof-of-work is what makes it almost unhackable. A hacker who would want to get the message would have to add as many nonce to get the same result. This is a cryptographic puzzle that takes high computational power and a lot of time. The very reason I mentioned it as ‘almost unhackable’. Another way to establish a proof-of-work is to use a newer technology called zk-snark (Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Argument of Knowledge). This still validates the work but doesn’t reveal any knowledge of the data. To understand it better, you would need to understand how Ethereum (an open-source, public, blockchain-based distributed computing platform and operating system) adopted and implemented it. Now you got the juice of it and so let’s complete the contract by signing it. To make it digitally signed, a public-private key pair is to be used. Suppose, X is creating a smart contract for Y. Y has its own public-private key pair. X will then encrypt the contract with Y’s public key. Y will then be able to decrypt the smart contract from its own private key. Thus, you get a smart contract.

The other aspect of a contract, economics, must hold both parties responsible too. Therefore, a legal angle is necessary. But in an decentralized economy, how would you hold someone responsible? Economically speaking, the contract has to have a reward and punishment system too. A cryptocurrency would be apt here. Upon successful mining of the block, there has to be an exchange of cryptocurrency to the successful miner. Upon failure, this has to be taken away. There can be other ways to incorporate economics angle into a smart contract too. As I never created a smart contract, neither owned it, nor transacted using it and so putting irrelevant ideas would be absurd for me.

## Smart Publishing: How smart is it?
Publishing and media industry constantly fights with copyright issues. We see someone’s article, music, video, or any artistic creation being duplicated and conveyed in different digital forms and do nothing about it. No matter how it comes, everyone is waiting to grab a free content on web. For those who look for some sort of redemption, smart publishing (based on smart contract/blockchain) can become a viable solution.

Developers, testers, and technical writers would know how [Github](https://github.com/) solves our basic needs of version control. Smart contract is an extension of that. The difference being that there cannot be a merge conflict because no one is holding up any information. To an extent, you can mine a block (similar to creating a branch), commit your changes, and push it to join the rest of the blockchain (Github’s branch). Validation of that block will merge it to the blockchain (similar to a Pull request without merge conflicts). And because the blockchain cannot be owned by a single entity, the miner (contributor) of that piece of block can always hope for his/her royalty. I know it’s a bit technical but I think I found the most easy and apt way to explain.

People have already gathered and designed systems on blockchain to secure web content and its copyrights issue. If you are already a content creator, [Po.et](https://www.po.et/) is doing its bit to help you. It allows you to add your content to the blockchain independent of where you are publishing. The latest that I’m aware of is that if you have a wordpress blog, you can install its plugin and let your content be a part of the blockchain. The second biggest issue that content creators face is signing up for unnecessary advertisements. People often fall prey to Google Adwords/Adsense and let their content suffer from vague advertisements floating all around and still not get fully paid. To rescue, [Amino Pay](https://www.aminopay.com/) has a better solution in place that lets its blockchain technology to be transparent and accessible.

If you are not ready for all these different technology players, you can always opt for [Publica](https://publica.com/). It’s an open platform that lets you do everything at one place.

And if you are looking to start somewhere fresh into this exciting new technology, I would suggest that you look into Steemit and [Graphite Docs](https://app.graphitedocs.com/).
